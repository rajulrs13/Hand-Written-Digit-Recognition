# Hand Written Digit Recognition

This project is made in Python 3 using a simple feed-forward neural network. The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist "Original MNIST Dataset"). But in this project the dataset is used a little differently. (Modified version is also included.)

This project does not use libraries like tensorflow , keras etc. It only uses numpy as a non-standard library and is made solely using mathematical equations. Every effort is made to drop in-line comments to for easy understanding.

To see it in action, a guide [Steps To Follow](Instructions.md) is also included.
